This week on our [podcast](http://shavua.net) (careful, Hebrew) we talked about my now defunct consulting business, which in it's last year of operation made me hundreds of thousands of dollars at rates north of $200/hour. I got some follow up questions, I'm collecting my answers here.

### How do you go about explaining your much above market rate prices to customers?

I solve problems for free until there's nothing to explain and it's clear to all sides that my cost is much less than their gain. For this method to work, two things are necessary:

1. An appropriate pipeline which brings in the right potential clients. These clients (a) have large problems I can solve big time and (b) have enough money to easily spend tens of thousands of dollars if it makes sense to them.
2. A method which lets me deliver value fast. The key here is *deliver* not *explain*. The fast part enables the pipeline's economics. If it wasn't fast I couldn't do it for free, if I couldn't do it for free my work would be a lot tougher to sell.

The whole thing works when after one or two meetings the client understands how my work is changing significant outcomes for their business, at which point cost is pretty much not an issue as long as they have the money available. 

The hard questions around charging high rates are (1) how do you develop the skills to actually do work that is worth tens of thousands of dollars a month (or more!) and (2) how do you put yourself in front of people who have these problems and actually deliver solutions that are so obvious that hiring you for more solutions is a no brainer. 

### How do you manage conflicts with clients?

The most important thing to understand is that if you have a conflict you already lost, you're now in damage control mode. When things go well conflict almost never happens. I haven't had a conflict with a client in years, used to have them all the time.

If you do have a conflict optimise for ending it. These things can be a real drag and there's basically no limit on how bad it can get. You'll also want an agreement structure that makes the option of "hey, this isn't working out, let's just call it a day" feasible. This means as much time based billing as possible and as little fixed deliverables as possible. 

### How do you fire a client?

You sit them down, explain transparently why you don't want to continue the work and because you're not a douche you give them as much control over the wind down process as possible.

### How do you manage your work-life balance as a consultant? 

The best thing you can do for your work life balance is have clients that crazy appreciate your work (first step: do work that is worth crazy appreciating). That dynamic changes everything, you'll get no pressure from your clients and how you manage your work life balance will be entirely up to you. 

If you find yourself thinking: "sure, that's easy for someone who is already established", one way to do work that is crazy appreciated without being established is to really care about your output. That almost always works and never requires experience or connections.
### How do you get people to approach you for work? A blog? Talks? High profile projects? Free consulting meetings? 

In my case, all of the above. In the general case, find ways to deliver as much value as possible to as many people as possible. Nothing sells your services better than actually delivering small portions of it to the right people. 

High profile projects are useful, but you want your clients to hire you because *you've already helped them*. They've already learned from you, you already solved problems for them, through a blog, a talk, a meeting, whatever. At that point, your skills are not under examination. You can't fake solving someone's problems.
